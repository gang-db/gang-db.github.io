## Immigrants and Gang Databases Amendment

### Amendment Text

WHEREAS The Trump administration has used the terms "criminals" and "gang members" to demonize immigrants and justify mass deportations to the public and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agency has used contact with law enforcement and the label of "gang member" to target individuals for apprehension and deportation; 

WHEREAS several cities -- including Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles -- use databases of alleged gang-associated individuals (i.e. "gang databases") with an extremely low threshold of proof for inclusion in the database and these databases are generally connected to federal databases accessed by ICE; 

WHEREAS there is evidence that individuals as young as 18 months old have been included in these gang databases and that inclusion in such gang databases has led to student deportations and deportations of parents apprehended while bringing their children to school; 

...

RESOLVED that the American Federation of Teachers calls on municipal and state governments and law enforcement agencies to cease the use of "gang databases" with a low threshold for inclusion and for the federal government to cease using inclusion in such databases as a justification for apprehension and deportation.
