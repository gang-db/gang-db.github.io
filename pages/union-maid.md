## Union Maid

> Words and Music by Woody Guthrie  
Final verse modernized by the multitude

There once was a union maid, she never was afraid  
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.  
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,  
And when the Legion boys come &rsquo;round  
She always stood her ground.

### Chorus

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,  
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.  
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,  
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,  
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.  
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.  
She'd show her card to the National Guard  
And this is what she'd say

> ### Chorus

Oh women who want to be free, well here's a tip from me
Break out of that mold we've all been sold, you've got a fighting history.
The fight for women's rights with the unions must union
Like Mother Jones gotta move them bones
To the front of every fight.

> ### Chorus
