## Love Me, I'm a Liberal

> Original by Phil Ochs  
Revisions by Candace Cohn

I cried when they shot Medgar Evers  
Tears ran down my spine  
I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy  
As though I’d lost a father of mine  
But Malcolm X got what was coming  
He got what he asked for this time  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I’m for a minimum wage hike  
And women paid on equal par  
I love Beyoncé and Oprah  
Hope every Dreamer becomes a star  
But don’t talk about revolution  
That’s going a little too far  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I vote for the Democratic Party  
They’ll move to the left soon, I think  
I still play Pete Seeger’s albums  
He sure gets me fired up to sing  
I’ll protest if Bernie is speaking  
But not to confront the right wing  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I hate state thugs and dictators  
Why can’t they just leave us alone?  
Kim Jong Un, Duterte, and Putin  
Should all be overthrown  
But after 9/11,  
We need a police state at home  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I know that state welfare programs  
Were needed some decades ago  
When the ’30s and later the ’60s  
Threatened to blow from below  
By the ’80s, though, Clinton convinced me  
The welfare bums just had to go  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I’m firmly against gerrymandering  
By the racist Republican right  
They strive to protect every voter  
So long as he’s for them and white  
But I backed the Dems on mass lockups  
To jail every Black man on sight  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

I hate Donald Trump’s deportations  
It’s our melting pot that makes us strong  
Trump’s policies on immigration  
Are cruel and racist and wrong  
But I supported Obama  
While he sent even more folks back “home”  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal

Trump’s failings at state diplomacy  
Are skewered in late night show mirth  
He’s lowered American standing,  
He’s ruined our embassies’ worth  
Oh give me imperialist Democrats  
Who’d control all the rest of the earth  
So love me, love me, love me, I’m a liberal
