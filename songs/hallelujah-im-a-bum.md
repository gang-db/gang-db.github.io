## Hallelujah! I'm a Bum

> Lyrics: Harry McClintock  
Melody: Traditional Hymn "Revive Us Again"

Rejoice and be glad for the Springtime has come  
We can throw down our shovels and go on the bum  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

The Springtime has come and I'm just out of jail  
Without any money, without any bail  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

I went to a house and I rapped on the door  
And the lady says, "Bum, bum, you've been here before"  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

I like Jim Hill, he's a good friend of mine  
That is why I am hiking down Jim Hill's main line  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

I went to a house and I asked for some bread  
And the lady says, "Bum, bum, the baker is dead"  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

Why don't you work like other men do  
Now, how can I work when there's no work to do  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

Why don't you save all the money you earn  
If I didn't eat, I'd have money to burn  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again

I don't like work and work don't like me  
And that is the reason I am so hungry  
Hallelujah, I'm a bum, Hallelujah, bum again  
Hallelujah, give us a handout to revive us again
