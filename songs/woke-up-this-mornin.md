## Woke Up this Mornin' with My Mind

> Adaptation of traditional music by SNCC Freedom Singers

Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.

I'm walkin' and talkin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm walkin' and talkin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm walkin' and talkin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.

I'm workin' and strugglin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm workin' and strugglin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm workin' and strugglin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Ain't nothin' wrong with my mind stayed on freedom
Oh, ain't nothin' wrong keepin' my mind stayed on freedom
There ain't nothin' wrong keepin' your mind stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this mornin' with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
