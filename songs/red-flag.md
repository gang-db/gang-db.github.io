## The Red Flag

The people's flag is deepest red,  
It shrouded oft our martyred dead,  
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,  
Their hearts' blood dyed its ev'ry fold.

### Chorus

Then raise the scarlet standard high.  
Within its shade we'll live and die,  
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,  
We'll keep the red flag flying here.

Look 'round, the Frenchman loves its blaze,  
The sturdy German chants its praise,  
In Moscow's vaults its hymns are sung  
Chicago swells the surging throng.

> Chorus

It waved above our infant might,  
When all ahead seemed dark as night;  
It witnessed many a deed and vow,  
We must not change its colour now.

> Chorus

It well recalls the triumphs past,  
It gives the hope of peace at last;  
The banner bright, the symbol plain,  
Of human right and human gain.

> Chorus

It suits today the weak and base,  
Whose minds are fixed on pelf and place  
To cringe before the rich man's frown,  
And haul the sacred emblem down.

> Chorus

With heads uncovered swear we all  
To bear it onward till we fall;  
Come dungeons dark or gallows grim,  
This song shall be our parting hymn.

> Chorus
