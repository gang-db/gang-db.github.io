## They'll Never Keep Us Down

> by Hazel Dickens

United we stand, divided we fall  
For every dime they give us a battle must be fought  
So working people use your power the key to liberty  
Don't support the rich man's style of luxury

There ain't no way they can ever keep us down, oh no  
There ain't no way they can ever keep us down  
We won't be bought, we won't be sold, To be treated right, well that's our goal  
There ain't no way they can ever keep us down

We've been shot, we've been jailed, lord its a sin  
Women and little children stood right by the men  
We've got a union contract that keeps the worker free  
They'll never shoot that union out of me

They'll never shoot that union out of me, oh no  
They'll never shoot that union out of me  
Got a contract in our hand signed by the blood of honest men  
They'll never shoot that union out of me

The power wheel is rolling, rolling right along  
The government helps keep it going going strong  
So working people get your help from your own kind  
Your welfare ain’t on the rich man's mind

Your welfare ain’t on that rich man's mind, oh no,  
Your welfare ain’t on that rich man's mind  
They want the power in their hands just to keep down the worker and  
Your welfare ain’t on the rich man's mind

They'll never, never, never keep us down, oh no  
They'll never, never, never keep us down  
They can cheat, lie, frame or steal, but we'll stop that big wheel  
They'll never, never, never keep us down
