## Internationale

Arise, you prisoners of starvation!  
Arise, you wretched of the earth!  
For justice thunders condemnation:  
A better world's in birth!

No more tradition's chains shall bind us,  
Arise you slaves, no more in thrall!  
The earth shall rise on new foundations:  
We have been naught, we shall be all!

> ### CHORUS

> 'Tis the final conflict,  
Let each stand in their place.  
The international working class  
Shall free the human race

> 'Tis the final conflict,  
Let each stand in their place.  
The international working class  
Shall free the human race

We want no condescending saviors  
To rule us from their judgment hall,  
We workers ask not for their favors  
Let us consult for all!

To make the thief disgorge his booty  
To free the spirit from its cell,  
We must ourselves decide our duty,  
We must decide, and do it well.

> CHORUS
