## Dark as a Dungeon

> by Merle Travis

Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,  
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines.  
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul,  
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal.

### Chorus

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew,  
Where danger is double and pleasures are few,  
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines  
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.

It's a-many a man I have seen in my day,  
Who lived just to labor his whole life away.  
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine,  
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines

> Chorus

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll,  
My body will blacken and turn into coal.  
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home,  
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

> Chorus
