## Connolly Was There

> Words by Dominic Behan, Music traditional

Well there is a page in history when the workers they fought back  
When the might of exploitation at last began to crack  
In farm and field and factory, in workshop, mine and rail  
A flame is lit; a beacon bright; that flame is burning still

### Chorus

And Connolly was there, Connolly was there  
Bold, brave and undaunted; James Connolly was there.

Now William Martin Murphy and his Dublin Millionaires  
Tried bribery, corruption, hypocrisy and prayers  
To spite the Transport Union their scats they did enlist  
But all their graft was shattered by a scarlet iron fist

> Chorus

When the bosses tried to sweat the lads way down on Glasgow's Clyde  
A voice like roaring thunder soon shook them in their stride  
In Liverpool and Belfast where worker lives in Hell  
But Connolly rose and gave them hope, the truth to you I tell.

> Chorus

Oh Irishmen the day will come when workers one and all  
will rise up from their bended knee and rally to the call  
Throw out the bosses tyranny and shout from shore to shore  
For a workersâ€™ Republic and freedom evermore.

> Chorus
