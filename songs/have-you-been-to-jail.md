## Have You Been To Jail For Justice?

> By Anne Feeney

Was it Cesar Chavez? Maybe it was Dorothy Day  
Some will say Dr. King or Gandhi set them on their way  
No matter who your mentors are it's pretty plain to see  
That, if you've been to jail for justice, you're in good company

Have you been to jail for justice? I want to shake your hand  
Cause sitting in and lyin' down are ways to take a stand  
Have you sung a song for freedom? or marched that picket line?  
Have you been to jail for justice? Then you're a friend of mine

You law abiding citizens, come listen to this song  
Laws were made by people, and people can be wrong  
Once unions were against the law, but slavery was fine  
Women were denied the vote and children worked the mine

The system is protected by laws and the police  
So when the system fails it's up to us to speak our peace  
It takes eternal vigilance for justice to prevail  
So get courage from your convictions  
Let them haul you off to jail!
