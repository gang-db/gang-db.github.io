## Gonna Be an Engineer

> by Peggy Seeger

When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy  
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys  
Everybody said I only did it to annoy  
But I was gonna be an engineer

Mamma said, "Why can't you be a lady?  
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl  
Wait until you're older, dear  
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow  
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk  
Learn to coo, learn to moo  
That's what you do to be a lady, now

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read  
History, geography and home economy  
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need  
To while away the extra time until the time to breed  
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?  
I says, "I'm gonna be an engineer!"

"No, you only need to learn to be a lady  
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world  
An engineer could never have a baby  
Remember, dear, that you're a girl"

She's smart - for a woman  
I wonder how she got that way?  
You get no choice, you get no voice  
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb  
That's how you come to be a lady, today

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly  
Working out the day and night so I could qualify  
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh  
Said, "I've never had an engineer!"  
"You owe it to the job to be a lady  
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl  
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe  
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl"

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation  
We were busy every night with loving recreation  
I spent my days at work so he could get an education  
And now he's an engineer!

He said: "I know you'll always be a lady  
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life  
Could an engineer look after or obey me?  
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!"

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again  
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then  
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them  
"Your mother was an engineer!"  
"You owe it to the kids to be a lady  
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow  
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby  
Remember you're a mother now!"

Every time I turn around there's something else to do  
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two  
Listening to Jimmy Young - it makes me want to spew  
I was gonna be an engineer

I only wish that I could be a lady  
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's s'posed to do  
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me  
Then I could be a person too

What price for a woman?  
You can buy her for a ring of gold  
To love and obey, without any pay  
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse  
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;  
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back  
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that  
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says "We pay you as a lady  
You only got the job because I can't afford a man  
With you I keep the profits high as may be  
You're just a cheaper pair of hands."

You got one fault, you're a woman;  
You're not worth the equal pay  
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart  
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool  
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school  
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool  
And an underpaid engineer  
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby  
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear  
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady  
I'll fight them as an engineer!
