## The Soup Song

> Lyrics by Maurice Sugar  
To the tune of My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean

I'm spending my nights in the flop house  
I'm spending my nights on the street.  
I'm looking for work and I find none,  
I wish I had something to eat.

### Chorus

Soo-oooop, soo-oooop.
They give me a bowl of soup.
Soo-oooop, soo-oooop.
They give me a bowl of soup.

I spent twenty year in the fact'ry.  
I did everything I was told.  
They said I was loyal and faithful.  
Now, even before I get old:

> Chorus

I saved fifteen bucks with my banker.  
To buy me a car and a yacht.  
I went down to draw out my fortune,  
And this is the answer I got:

> Chorus

I fought in the war for my country.  
I went out to bleed and to die;  
I thought that my country would help me.  
But this was my country's reply:

> Chorus

I fell on my knee to my Maker;  
I prayed every night to the Lord.  
I swore to be faithful forever.  
And now I've received my reward.

> Chorus
