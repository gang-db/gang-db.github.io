## All You Fascists

> by Woody Guthrie

I'm gonna tell all you fascists you may be surprised  
The people in this world are getting organized  
You're bound to lose, you fascists are bound to lose

Race hatred cannot stop us this one thing I know  
Your poll tax and jim crow and greed have got to go  
You're bound to lose, you fascists bound to lose  

All of you fascists bound to lose  
You fascists bound to lose  
All of you fascists bound to lose  
You fascists bound to lose  
Youâ€™re bound to lose! you fascists!  
Bound to lose

People of every colour marching side by side  
Marching across these fields where a million fascists died  
You're bound to lose, you fascists bound to lose

I'm going into this battle, and take my union gun  
We'll end this world of slavery before this battle's won  
You're bound to lose, you fascists bound to lose
