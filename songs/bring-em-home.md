## Bring 'Em Home

> by Pete Seeger, Jim Musselman

If you love your Uncle Sam  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Support our boys in Vietnam  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

If you love this land, our land,  
Bring 'em home. bring 'em home  
Support our troops in Afghanistan  
Bring 'em home. bring 'em home

If you want a land of the free  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em back from overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

The politicians would be sad. I know  
Bring 'em home. bring 'em home  
They wanna tangle with their foe  
Bring 'em home. bring 'em home

They serve the monopolies  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
For the greed in someone's eyes  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

We need food and homes and schools  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
No more wars for the richest few  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

If you love your Uncle Sam  
Bring 'em home. bring 'em home  
Bring Â·em home from every land  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
