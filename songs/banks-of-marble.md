## The Banks are Made of Marble, song lyrics

> Original music and lyrics by Les Rice

I've traveled &rsquo;round this country,  
From shore to shining shore;  
It really made me wonder,  
The things I heard and saw.

I saw the weary farmer,  
Plowing sod and loam,  
I heard the auction hammer,  
A knocking down his home.

But the banks are made of marble,  
With a guard at every door,  
And the vaults are stuffed with silver,  
That the farmer sweated for.

I saw the seaman standing,  
Idly by the shore,  
I heard their bosses saying,  
"Got no work for you no more"

But the banks are made of marble,  
With a guard at every door,  
And the vaults are stuffed with silver,  
That the seaman sweated for.

I saw the weary miner,  
Scrubbing coal dust from his back,  
And I heard his children crying,  
"Got no coal to heat the shack."

But the banks are made of marble,  
With a guard at every door,  
And the vaults are stuffed with silver,  
That the miner sweated for.

I've seen my brothers working,  
Throughout this mighty land,  
I prayed we'd get together,  
And together make a stand.

Then we'd own those banks of marble,  
With a guard at every door,  
And we would share those vaults of silver,  
That we have sweated for!
