## Woke Up this Mornin' with My Mind

> Adaptation of traditional music by SNCC Freedom Singers

Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu. Hallelu, Hallelujah.

I'm walking and talking with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm walking and talking with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm walking and talking with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, HaUelujah.

I'm working and struggling with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm working and struggling with my mind stayed on freedom  
I'm working and struggling with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, HaUelujah.

Ain't nothing wrong with my mind stayed on freedom
Oh. ain't nothing wrong keeping my mind stayed on freedom
There ain't nothing wrong keeping your mind stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, HaUelujah.

Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom  
Hallelu. Hallelu, Hallelujah.
