## We Shall Not Be Moved

### Chorus

We shall not, we shall not be moved  
We shall not, we shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
We shall not be moved

We are fighting for our freedom,  
We shall not be moved  
We are fighting for our freedom ,  
We shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
We shall not be moved

> Chorus

We are Black and white together,  
We shall not be moved  
We are Black and white together,  
We shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
We shall not be moved

> Chorus

We will stand and fight together,  
We shall not be moved  
We will stand and fight together,  
We shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
We shall not be moved
