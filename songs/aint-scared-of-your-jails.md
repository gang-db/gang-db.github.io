## Ain’t Scared of Your Jails

> Written by Lester Cobb    
Performed by Chuck Neblett

I ain't a-scared of your jails    
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom    
I want my freedom    
I ain't a-scared of your jails    
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom NOW!

I ain't a-scared of your dogs  
’Cause I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I ain't a-scared of your dogs  
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom NOW!

We'll march downtown  
’Cause we want our freedom  
We want our freedom  
We want our freedom  
We'll march downtown  
’Cause we want our freedom    
We want our freedom NOW!

I ain't a-scared of your tear gas  
’Cause I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I ain't a-scared of your tear gas  
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom NOW!

I don't mind dyin'  
’Cause I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom NOW!

I ain't a-scared of your jails  
'Cause I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I want my freedom  
I ain't a-scared of your jails  
’Cause I want my freedom    
I want my freedom NOW!
