## A Mighty Force Is Workers' Power

> Tune: EIN FESTE BURG
("A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" because why should the revival hymns get all the better lyrics?)

A mighty force is workers' power, when united ne'er failing  
Protection strong amidst the flood of bourgeois ills prevailing  
For still our cap't'list foe does seek the workers' woe  
Their craft and power are great and armed with racist hate  
Lone workers cannot equal


Did we in separate strengths confide, our striving would be losing  
Were not our comrades at our side, in democratic choosing  
Dost ask how we might win? By organizing in  
Party and unions strong, to build this struggle long  
For we must win the battle


Ruling ideas with wedges filled may threaten to undo us  
They'll not divide what we have built in solidarity truest  
The bosses' lackeys grim, we tremble not for them  
Their rage we can endure, we can make their doom sure  
Organized strong, we'll fell them


Our working class above their powers: their gravedigger abideth  
The means of all production ours, the work we do provideth  
Let wage and bosses go, this poverty also  
This exploitation kills; our class abideth still  
Till class itself is ended
