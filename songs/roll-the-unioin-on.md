## Roll the Union On

> Music and Lyrics by John L. Handcox

We’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll the union on  
We’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll the union on  
And, if the boss gets in the way  
We’re gonna roll right over him  
We’re gonna roll it over him  
We’re gonna roll it over him  
And, if the boss gets in the way  
We’re gonna roll right over him  
We’re gonna roll the union on

Use the same pattern with:

And, if the scabs get in the way...  
And, if gun thugs get in the way...  
And, if the cops get in the way...  
And, if Rahm gets in the way...  
And, if Trump gets in the way...  
et alia
