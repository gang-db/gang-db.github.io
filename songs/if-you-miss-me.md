## If You Miss Me at the Back of the Bus

> By Carver Neblett  
(Verses are often improvised)  

If you miss me at the back of the bus, and you can't find me nowhere    
Come on up to the front of the bus, I'll be ridin' right there    
I'll be ridin' right there    
I'll be ridin' right there    
You got to come on up to the front of the bus    
I'll be ridin' right there

If you miss me in the cotton fields, and you can't find me nowhere    
Come on down to the picket line, I'll be marchin' right there  
I'll be marchin' right there  
I'll be marchin' right there  
Come on down to the picket line, I'll be marchin' right there  
I'll be marchin' right there

If you miss me on the picket lines, and you can't find me nowhere    
Come on down to the jailhouse. I'll be roomin' over there    
I'll be roomin' over there    
I'll be roomin' over there    
Come on down to the jailhouse    
I'll be roomin' over there

If you miss me in the Mississippi River, and you can't find me nowhere    
Come on over to the city' pool, I'll be bathin' over there    
I'll be bathin' over there    
I'll be bathin' over there    
Come on over to the city' pool    
I'll be bathin' over there

If you miss me at the back of the bus, and you can't find me nowhere    
Come on up to the front of the bus, I'll be rid in' right there    
I'll be ridin' right there    
I'll be ridin' right there    
You got to come on up to the front of the bus    
I'll be ridin' right there
