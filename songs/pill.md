## The Pill 

> by Loretta Lynn

You wined me and dined me when I was your girl  
Promised if I'd be your wife you'd show me the world  
But all I've seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill  
I'm tearin' down your brooder house cause now I've got the pill

All these years I've stayed at home while you had all your fun  
And every year that's gone by another baby's come  
There's gonna be some changes made right here on nursery hill  
You've set this chicken your last time cause now I've got the pill

This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage  
The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage  
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills  
Yeah, I'm makin' up for all those years since I've got the pill

I'm tired of all your crowing, how you and your hens play  
While holdin' a couple in my arms another's on the way  
This chicken's done tore up her nest and I'm ready to make a deal  
And you can't afford to turn it down cause you know I've got the pill

This incubator is overused because you've kept it filled  
The feelin' good comes easy now since I've got the pill  
It's gettin' dark, it's roostin' time, tonight's too good to be real  
Oh but daddy don't you worry none cause momma's got the pill  
Oh daddy don't you worry none cause momma's got the pill
