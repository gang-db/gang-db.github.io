## Which Side Are You On?

> Music traditional  
Based on words by Florence Reese

Come all of you good workers.  
Good news to you I'll tell  
Of how the good old union  
Has come in here to dwell.

### Chorus

Which side are you on?  
Which side are you on?  
Which side are you on?  
Which side are you on?

My daddy was a miner,  
My mom a worker too,  
And I'll stick with the union  
'Til every battle's through.

> Chorus

We're fighting for our future  
We're fighting for fifteen  
Oh will you stand beside us  
Or with the Koch machine?

> Chorus

They say in the school system,  
There are no neutrals there;  
You're with the kids and workers,  
Or with the billionaires.

> Chorus

Oh workers can you stand it?  
Oh tell me how you can.  
Oh will you let them beat you down  
Or will you take a stand?

> Chorus

The one percent get richer  
While we get less and less  
They've stolen everything they can  
And now they want the rest

> Chorus

Don't scab for the bosses,  
Don't listen to their lies.  
Us poor folks haven't got a chance  
Unless we organize.

> Chorus
