## I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free

I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that I should say  
Say ’em loud say ’em clear  
For the whole round world to hear

I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove all the bars  
That keep us apart  
I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then you'd see and agree  
That every man should be free

I wish I could give  
All I'm longin' to give  
I wish I could live  
Like I'm longin' to live  
I wish I could do  
All the things that I can do  
Though I'm way overdue  
I'd be starting anew.

Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found I could fly  
I'd soar to the sun  
And look down at the sea  
And I sing 'cause I know  
How it feels to be free
