## In old Moscow

In old Moscow, in the Kremlin,  
In the fall of ‘39,  
Sat a Russian and a Prussian  
Writing out the party line

### Chorus

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling,  
Oh, my darling party line;  
Oh, I never will desert you,  
For I love this life of mine.

Leon Trotsky was a Nazi;  
Oh, we know it for a fact.  
Pravda said it; we all read it,  
Before the Stalin-Hitler Pact.

> Chorus

Once a Nazi would be shot, see,  
That was then the Party Line;  
Now a Nazi’s hotsy-totsy,  
Trotsky’s laying British mines.

> Chorus

Now the Nazis and the Fuerher  
Stand within the Party Line,  
All the Russians love the Prussians,  
Volga boatmen sail the Rhine.

> Chorus
