## Carry It On (Original)

> Music & Lyrics by Gil Turner


There's a man by my side walking  
There's a voice within me talking  
There's a voice within me saying  
Carry it on, carry it on 

They will tell their empty stories  
Send their dogs to bite our bodies  
They will lock us up in prison  
Carry it on, carry it on 

When you can't go on any longer  
Take the hand of your brother  
Every victory brings another  
Carry it on, carry it on 

Carry it on, carry it on

> Hear [Joan Baez sing Carry It On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LydhpGsdWt0) on YouTube.
